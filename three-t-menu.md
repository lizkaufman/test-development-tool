# The Three T's 

## Technical, Teaching, Team 

Pick three points you would like to improve. 

Remember it doesn't need to be one from each, you can read through and pick any
you feel would help you develop into a more confident and skilled coach and developer. 

### Goals must be: 
**S** = Specific, clear goal 
**M** = Measurable, must be able to track progress
**A** = Attainable, keep it realistic 
**R** = Relevant 
**T** = Time-bound, create realistic timelines for all your actions


### Technical 

- Strong baseline of knowledge around fundamental programming concepts; must include JavaScript 
- Ability to self-teach and upskill at pace (ability to know first principles and then be able to gather specifics from docs and resources)
- Desire to be a T-shaped engineer, with both breadth of knowledge across tech, continuously adding skills, tools, and languages, and a niche area in which to specialize and provide expertise to the rest of the coaching team
- Awareness of latest tech developments
- Engineering mindset, with the ability to put concepts together to build more complicated applications and solve complex problems
- Advanced understanding of good practices and clean, efficient code, with the ability to consciously refactor code (and articulate why)

### Teaching 

- Ability to articulate programming concepts, building up from first principles and tying concepts to real life metaphors
- Ability to put together teaching materials (lectures and workshops) that follow the School of Code teaching philosophy 
- Confidence when speaking and live-coding in front of an audience of a class full of bootcampers
- Flexibility to respond to unexpected questions and curiosity from bootcampers, to reframe explanations when needed, and to tailor the speed of teaching to the bootcampersâ€™ rate of understanding (a coach should balance planning and preparation with the ability to think on their feet)
- Ability to strike the balance of unblocking bootcampers without giving away the answers, with the focus always on helping them be independent and self-directed learners
- Confidence to go into pairs and small groups of bootcampers to coach and answer questions
- Ability to be at peace with not always knowing all the answers, and when these occasions do occur, to model bug fixing, reading and digesting errors, Googling, and creative problem solving

### Team

- Fully comfortable with giving and receiving constructive feedback with a focus on continuous improvement, individually and for the team
- Focus on a growth mindset
- Active participation in team meetings and discussions
- Balance between working hard and participating in the fun we have as a team (energizers, team-building activities, banter, etc.)
- Ability to balance focus between the current set of bootcampers and the wider aims and mission of the future of the School of Code
